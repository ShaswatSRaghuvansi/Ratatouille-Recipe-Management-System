Here are all the SQL queries used in the provided Java code, combined in one place:

`Check if a recipe with the same name exists:
SELECT count(c) FROM Recipe c WHERE recipeName = :recipeName

`Add a new recipe to the database:
INSERT INTO Recipe (recipe_name, ingredients, preparation_steps, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

`Update an existing recipe in the database:
UPDATE Recipe SET recipe_name = ?, ingredients = ?, preparation_steps = ?, updated_at = ? WHERE recipe_id = ?

`Delete a recipe from the database (soft delete):
UPDATE Recipe SET isDeleted = true WHERE recipe_id = ?

`View all recipes in the database:
SELECT * FROM Recipe r WHERE r.isDeleted = 0

`View recipes with given ingredients in the database:
SELECT * FROM Recipe r WHERE r.ingredients LIKE :ingredient AND r.isDeleted = 0

`Retrieve a recipe by its ID from the database:
SELECT * FROM Recipe c WHERE recipe_id = :id AND isDeleted = 0

`Get the number of likes for a specific recipe:
SELECT COUNT(rl) FROM RecipeLike rl WHERE rl.recipe.recipeId = :recipeId
